## Installation

### Dependencies

#### MelonLoader

MelonLoader is used to load and inject the mods into games built in Unity.

1. Download the latest release of [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=automated-installation).

2. Install MelonLoader into the game installation folder e.g. `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\SUPERHOT VR\` manually or automatically via the `MelonLoader.Installer.exe`. Instructions for both methods can be found [here](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/).

  

#### Other dependencies

TBD

### Download and install the mod

TBD, but the process will essentially be:

1. Download `SuperhotVrEeg.dll` from the latest mod [release](https://github.com/smcmanis/SuperhotVR_EEG/releases/latest).

2. Put the `SuperhotVrEeg.dll` file in the `Mods` directory created by MelonLoader in the game installation folder: `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\SUPERHOT VR\Mods\SuperhotVrEeg.dll`.  

## Usage

### Start-up
Following successful installation, launch the `SUPERHOTVR` executable.  

The game launch should be preceded by the MelonLoader console, which will show information such as any plugins and mods loaded. If the mod was installed correctly, it should load the mods on game launch and can be confirmed by inspecting the output under Mods in the console.
  

### In-game
